## ⚙️ Understanding Grain Processing

Whole grains contain natural compounds like phytic acid, lectins, and enzyme inhibitors, which protect the seed but can reduce nutrient absorption.  
Gentle processing methods improve both flavor and bioavailability.

  

|Method|Purpose|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Toasting|Lightly heats grain to bring out nutty flavor|Improves flavor, aids grinding|
|Soaking|Softens grains and reduces phytic acid|Increases mineral absorption|
|Sprouting|Starts germination|Boosts vitamins and enzymes|
|Cooking|Gelatinizes starch|Maximizes digestibility and flavor|
|Grinding|Breaks down grain into flour or meal|Useful for mixtures, may require prior prep|
