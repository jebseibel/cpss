/**
 * Throttles repeated failed logins from one IP address.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> {@code /api/auth/login} has to stay public — the browser cannot
 * carry a token before it has one — so it is the single unauthenticated door into a database
 * holding a real medical record. Without a limit, an attacker can try passwords as fast as the
 * network allows, and a common password falls in seconds. Every other control added today (JWT
 * on all endpoints, the token CRUD removal) is only worth as much as this door.
 *
 * <p><b>Only failures count.</b> A successful login clears the counter, so an ordinary person
 * mistyping a password twice and then getting it right is never locked out. What is being
 * limited is guessing, not using.
 *
 * <p><b>In-memory and per-instance</b>, which is honest about what it is. It resets on restart
 * and does not coordinate across instances — fine for a single-instance deployment, and it
 * raises the cost of an online guessing attack by orders of magnitude. It is not a defence
 * against a distributed attempt from many addresses; a strong password remains the real control.
 * If this ever runs behind more than one instance, move the counter to Redis.
 *
 * <p><b>Keyed on client IP AND username, not IP alone.</b> Per-IP alone is a denial of service:
 * failed guesses against any username lock out every other user from that address. Found exactly
 * that way — probing a fake username locked the real account out of the same machine. Behind a
 * proxy or CGNAT many people share one address, so an attacker could deliberately lock the
 * patient out of her own tool.
 *
 * <p>The IP half still matters: without it, one attacker could lock a known username from
 * anywhere. Honours {@code X-Forwarded-For} because in deployment Nginx sits in front and the
 * socket address would otherwise be the proxy for everyone.
